This document is about building other software on top of crosser
environment.

The same environment that is available for installing to target
Windows system, can be used to cross-build more software in Linux.

For building with it, the official dllstack builds of crosser assumes
that the environment resides in
/usr/crosser/<arch>stack-<version>, or
/usr/crosser/<arch>stack-full-<version>
That is; extract the environment package to /usr/crosser.

Those directories as symbolic link(s) to crosser environment actually
residing in another place should work too.
