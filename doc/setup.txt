Configuring dllstack.sh
=======================

dllstack.sh can be configured with files named /etc/crosser.conf,
local_setup.conf in main crosser directory (same directory
where dllstack.sh script is), .crosser.conf under home
directory or by file specified by environment variable CROSSER_CONF.
First it reads global configuration from /etc/crosser.conf if present.
In addition to that it tries to read one local configuration file in
following order:
If CROSSER_CONF environment variable is defined, dllstack.sh
try to read it and fail if they cannot. If environment variable is not defined,
they first look for local_setup.conf, and if it's missing load ~/.crosser.conf
instead.

This file lists some of the variables one can place to configuration file

Entries are of form:
VARIABLE=VALUE

Before configuration is read, variable $CROSSER_MAINDIR has been set.
It contains path to the directory where file CrosserVersion is. This is
either where full crosser packet is unpacked or, lacking such location,
/usr/share/crosser.
E.g. to set log directory under that main dir one would use
CROSSER_LOGDIR="$CROSSER_MAINDIR/log"

Also variable $CROSSER_TMPDIR is already set to its default value
before configuration is read, so it can be used in setting other
variables.

=======================================================================
DLLSPREFIX
 ; Directory hierarchy where generated dllstack environment will be installed.
 ; This path is parsed:
 ;   - <TARGET>     -> Target architecture
 ;   - <DATE>       -> Build start date. Note that build may take long time and
 ;                     often start date is not the same as current date of some
 ;                     build action.
 ;   - <VERSION>    -> Crosser version
 ;   - <VERSIONSET> -> Versionset used
 ;   - <SETUP>      -> Setup name
 ; Either exclose value inside quotes or escape like \<TARGET\>
 ;
 ; Default is $HOME/.crosser/<VERSION>/<VERSIONSET>/<SETUP>/winstack

CROSSER_HOST_PREFIX
 ; Directory hierarchy where native environment generated by dllstack.sh
 ; will be installed.
 ; Path parsing is similar to that of DLLSPREFIX.
 ; Default is $HOME/.crosser/<VERSION>/<VERSIONSET>/dllshost

CROSSER_WINVER
 ; Minimum Windows version we should support. Use numerical versions,
 ; not symbolic ones, e.g., Win7 should be given as '0x0601'
 ; and not as '_WIN32_WINNT_WIN7'
 ; THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL
 ; Current default is '0x0603' meaning Windows 8.1.

CROSSER_DEFAULT_SETUP
 ; Setup to use when one has not been given at commandline.
 ; Current default is "win64"

CROSSER_LOGLVL_STDOUT
CROSSER_LOGLVL_FILE
 ; Level of logging to screen and to file. Values can be from
 ; 1 (Fatal errors only) to 5 (debug logging).
 ; Defaults are 2 for screen and 4 for file.

CROSSER_FORCE
 ; If this is set to 'yes', scripts will not provide confirmation prompts
 ; when deleting old directories. It's recommended that this is never
 ; used in local_setup.conf and set as environment variable before running
 ; script only when setup has been already tested and one really knows
 ; that nothing important will be destroyed.

CROSSER_TMPDIR
 ; Default directory for temporary files. With more specific options
 ; you can change CROSSER_SRCDIR and CROSSER_BUILDDIR individually.
 ; Note that this directory is not emptied in the end but left to the
 ; state is was when build finished/failed for debugging build problems
 ; and the like.
 ; If you want to support running multiple crosser instances for several
 ; targets or versionsets simultaneously, you may set this as
 ; CROSSER_TMPDIR="$(tempfile)"
 ; Unlike with most configuration variables, default value for
 ; CROSSER_TMPDIR is already set before configuration file is read.
 ; Default is /tmp/crosser

CROSSER_SRCDIR
 ; Directory hierarchy where sources will be unpacked.
 ; Default is $CROSSER_TMPDIR/src

CROSSER_BUILDDIR
 ; Directory hierarchy where binaries will be built
 ; Default is $CROSSER_TMPDIR/build

CROSSER_LOGDIR
 ; Directory where logfiles will be written.
 ; Default is $HOME/.crosser/log
 ; Logfiles stdout.log and stderr are created anew for each build,
 ; main.log is rotated once it reaches 250000 bytes.

CROSSER_TMPDEL
 ; If this variable is set to value "yes", dllstack.sh will
 ; aggressively delete anything from temp directories as soon as
 ; it no longer needs it.

CROSSER_PACKETDIR
 ; Directory for storing source packets.
 ; Default is $HOME/.crosser/packets

CROSSER_DOWNLOAD
 ; This defines packet download model. Packets are ever downloaded only
 ; if they are missing, but time their existence is checked depends on
 ; this setting. Default is "demand".
 ;   "yes"           - dllstack.sh downloads all the required
 ;                     packets in the beginning.
 ;   "demand"        - On demand; download just when packet is really
 ;                     needed. This setting has advantage that not time
 ;                     and resources are wasted to downloading if
 ;                     compilation of some earlier component fails.
 ;   any other value - Assume that packets are already downloaded.
 ;                     Fail if not.
 ; Options other than "demand" have advantage that time is not wasted
 ; on compiling earlier packets in case some packet cannot be downloaded.

CROSSER_CORES
 ; Hint of number of CPU cores to use when parallel execution possible.
 ; Current default is number of cores detected in the system + 1

CROSSER_GROUP
 ; If set, some files crosser produces are set owned by that user group.
 ; Currently this applies to downloaded source packets.

CROSSER_FULL
 ; If set to value "yes", more components will be built by default.
 ; Currently this is like enabling CROSSER_QT6,
 ; CROSSER_READLINE, and CROSSER_SFML

CROSSER_QT6
 ; If set to value "yes", Qt6 will be built as part of crosser.
 ; Default value is "yes" if CROSSER_FULL is enabled.

CROSSER_SDL2
 ; Whether SDL2-chain should be built as part of crosser.
 ; Current default is 'yes'.

CROSSER_GTK
 ; If set to 'no', gtk-chain is not built. This implies lack of any
 ; gtk version from the build, and values of CROSSER_GTK3 and
 ; CROSSER_GTK4 have no effect.

CROSSER_GTK3
 ; Whether gtk3 parts of gtk-chain should be built. Current default is 'yes'.

CROSSER_GTK4
 ; Whether gtk4 parts of gtk-chain should be built. Current default is 'yes'.

CROSSER_SFML
 ; Whether sfml-chain should be built as part of crosser.
 ; Current default is "yes" if CROSSER_FULL is enabled.

CROSSER_READLINE
 ; If set to value "yes", readline will be built as part of crosser.
 ; Default value is "yes" if CROSSER_FULL is enabled.

CROSSER_PKGCONF
 ; Which program to use to parse .pc -files. Valid values are 'pkg-config'
 ; and 'pkgconf'. Default is 'pkgconf'

CROSSER_WGET
 ; Which program to use to download source packages. Valid values are 'wget'
 ; and 'wget2'. Default is 'wget'

=======================================================================

local_setup.conf is actually shell script fragment. Here are some things
one may want to do in it in addition to setting variables.

renice 15 $$
 ; Crosser build takes very long time. If you want to do something
 ; else with the computer meanwhile, you may want to make crosser low
 ; priority. That makes other tasks to run faster and crosser to use just
 ; those CPU cycles left over. Above command makes current script
 ; (dllstack.sh itself) to run at nice level 15.
