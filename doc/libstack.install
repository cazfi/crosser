Installing library stack produced by libstack.sh
================================================

Once library stack is copied to target environment, some files
must be regenerated to use correct paths. For build environment
these are generated automatically, if local setting AUTOWINE is
set to "yes".

In target environment files can be regenerated by running
setup.bat in library stack root directory.
