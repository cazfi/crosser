These changes are coming in future versions:

- Enable readline build by default (-> part of the ready-made build)
- Use win-iconv by default, drop libiconv
- Drop gtk2 from build -> later drop completely
- Drop sdl build completely
- Disable bzip2 build -> later drop completely
- Build zlib in separate build directory (zlib 1.2.9 and later should support this)
- Keep updated with gtk+-3.9x dependencies for being ready for gtk4
