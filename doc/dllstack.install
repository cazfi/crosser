Installing library stack produced by dllstack.sh
================================================

Once dll stack is copied to target environment, some files
must be regenerated to use correct paths. For build environment
these are generated automatically, if local setting AUTOWINE is
set to "yes". See setup.txt for requirements for enabling AUTOWINE.

In target environment files can be regenerated by running
setup.bat in dll stack root directory.
